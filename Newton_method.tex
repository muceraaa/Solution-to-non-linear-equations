\section{Newton-Raphson Method}

Suppose we want to find a root of the function $f(x)$ using the Newton-Raphson method. Here is the algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose an initial guess $x_0$.
\item Calculate $f(x_0)$ and $f'(x_0)$.
\item Let $x_1 = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$.
\item Calculate $f(x_1)$ and $f'(x_1)$.
\item Let $x_2 = x_1 - \frac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)}$.
\item Continue this process until the desired level of accuracy is achieved.
\end{enumerate}

The Newton-Raphson method is guaranteed to converge to a root of $f(x)$ provided that $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable, and the initial guess is sufficiently close to the root.
